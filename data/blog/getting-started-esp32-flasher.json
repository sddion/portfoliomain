This tool leverages the **Web Serial API** to allow you to communicate with your microcontrollers directly from your browser—no local drivers or Python environments required!\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- A device with **Chrome** or **Edge** browser (Web Serial support is mandatory).\n- A high-quality USB Data cable.\n- Your ESP32 or ESP8266 development board.\n- Firmware files in `.bin` format.\n\n## Step-by-Step Guide\n\n### 1. Connect your Device\nPlug your ESP32 into your computer. Open the **ESP Flasher** app from the SanjuOS desktop. \n\n### 2. Configure Connection\nSelect your preferred **Baud Rate** (115200 is standard and recommended for most boards). Click the **Connect ESP32** button. A browser popup will appear—select the serial port corresponding to your device (usually labeled as CP210x or CH340).\n\n### 3. Upload Firmware\nOnce connected, you'll see a 'Connected' status. Click on the upload area to select one or more `.bin` files. You can specify the flash address for each file (e.g., `0x1000` for common applications).\n\n### 4. Flash!\nClick **Flash Firmware**. You can monitor the progress in the real-time console at the bottom. Once finished, the tool will automatically perform a hard reset to boot your new firmware.\n\n![Interface Preview](/blog/flasher-interface.png)\n\n## Conclusion\n\nFlashing IoT devices has never been easier.
