    "content": "Guide: How to Flash your ESP32\n\nWelcome! If you've ever wanted to put new software (firmware) on your ESP32 or ESP8266 chip but found it too complicated, you're in the right place. Our **ESP32 Web Flasher** makes it as easy as browsing a website.\n\n### What do you need?\n\nBefore we start, make sure you have these simple things ready:\n- **A Computer** with the **Google Chrome** or **Microsoft Edge** browser. Other browsers might not work yet because we need a special feature called 'Web Serial'.\n- **A USB Cable** that can transfer data. (Note: some cables only charge phones and won't work for this!)\n- **Your Chip** (The ESP32 or ESP8266 board).\n- **The Software File** (A file ending in `.bin` that you want to put on your chip).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Plug it in\nConnect your chip to your computer using the USB cable. On your SanjuOS desktop, look for the **ESP Flasher** app and click to open it.\n\n### Step 2: Choosing the Right Speed\nIn the app, you'll see a setting called **Baud Rate**. Think of this as the 'talking speed' between your computer and the chip. \n\n> **Tip:** 115200 is the standard speed and works for almost everyone. Keep it at that unless you're an expert!\n\n### Step 3: Connecting via the Browser\nClick the big **Connect ESP32** button. A small window will pop up at the top of your browser. \n\n- Look for something labeled **'USB Serial Port'**, **'CP210x'**, or **'CH340'**.\n- Click on it, then click **Connect**.\n\nIf you see a green 'Connected' message, you're doing great!\n\n### Step 4: Loading your Software\nNow, click on the **Upload Area** (the box with the cloud icon). Choose your `.bin` file from your computer.\n\nMost software starts at 'Address' `0x0`. If your software guide says otherwise, you can change it, but `0x0` is usually the safest bet for beginners.\n\n### Step 5: The Magic Part - Flashing!\nClick the **Flash Firmware** button. You'll see some text scrolling at the bottom—that's just the computer talking to the chip. \n\n```terminal\nConnecting... OK\nErasing flash... OK\nWriting at 0x00001000... (10%)\nWriting at 0x00002000... (20%)\n... \nFlash Completed Successfully!\n```\n\nOnce it hits 100%, your chip will restart automatically with its new software!\n\n![Interface Preview](/blog/flasher-interface.png)\n\n### Questions?
